# tpnoisie

Make the ThinkPad TrackPoint make noises

## Functionality

The program reads the TrackPoint displacement data from the provided device file (e.g., `/dev/input/eventX`) and generates sound based on the movement intensity. `libinput` is used to read the input events. Compiling may require `libinput-devel` or equivalent.

## Installation & Usage

Pre-requisites: Rust and `libinput-devel` or equivalent installed, and sounds configured as follows:

Some directory `/path/to/wavsounds/` containing 10 WAV files named exactly `{0..9}.wav` representing increasing intensity levels.

```bash
# libinput-devel or similar may be required
cargo install --git https://github.com/ackledotdev/tpnoisie.git
tpnoisie # find TrackPoint, trackpad, or other pointer device location (e.g. /dev/input/eventX)
tpnoisie /dev/input/eventX /path/to/wavsounds/
```
